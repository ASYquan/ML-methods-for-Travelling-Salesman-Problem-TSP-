# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) — Evolutionary Techniques

This project implements multiple strategies to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and compares their performance:

- Exhaustive Search (baseline)
- Hill Climbing
- Genetic Algorithm (PMX crossover, inversion mutation, tournament selection)

The project loads real inter-city distance data and visualizes example tours on a map.  
Plots are automatically generated for:

- Best paths found
- Algorithm performance curves
- Population size comparison (for GA)

---

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate search vs heuristic approaches
- Compare exact vs stochastic optimization
- Explore GA behavior and convergence trends
- Visualize tours on map of Europe

---

## Running

```bash
python main.py
